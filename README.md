# LayerCI documentation

This repository is the open-source documentation page for [LayerCI](https://layerci.com).

LayerCI turns regular CI pipelines into staging server lambdas, so that you can share your work
with your team and get things merged the same day you make the changes.


# Contributing

We use standard markdown for these documents, but you can have a per-programming-language
section with `<language-tabs>`.

For readability, we expect a single h1 (#section) per file.
Each file is prefixed by a number, and they're rendered into the docs in sequential order.
