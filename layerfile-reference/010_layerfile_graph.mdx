# Multiple build steps: The Layerfile graph

Layerfiles can be composed, inherited from, and split into complex CI workflows.

Consider these three Layerfiles:

<br />


##### 1. Layerfile at (repo root)/Layerfile
```Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install postgresql python3
```

<br />

##### 2. Layerfile at (repo root)/web/tests/Layerfile
```Layerfile
FROM /Layerfile
COPY /web .
RUN ./unittest.sh
```

<br />

##### 3. Layerfile at (repo root)/web/Layerfile
```Layerfile
FROM /Layerfile
COPY /web .
RUN BACKGROUND ./start-webserver.sh
EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:8080
```

<br />

When built, these three Layerfiles will automatically combine into a build graph:

<br />

Here, webapp.io has searched for files named 'Layerfile', discovered all three of these files, and linked them based on their parents (by their FROM lines)

<br />

There are many directives which can change the Layerfile graph, see `SPLIT`, `BUTTON`, and `WAIT` below for some examples.
