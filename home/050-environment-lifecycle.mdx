## Environment Lifecycle

Environments (Layerfiles with <a href="/docs/layerfile-reference#the-expose-website-instruction">EXPOSE WEBSITE</a>, Layerfiles that expose a debug terminal, etc.) have three lifecycle levels:
<br />
- *Deleted*, which means you can't start them without rebuilding (rebuilding deletes everything, like your temporary database, registered user, and state in the environment).
- *Stopped*, which means you see a spinner as they start
- *Running*, which means it's currently running
<br />

##### Running to Stopped

The Running lifecycle to Stopped lifecycle happens for a few reasons:
- After 3 minutes of inactivity if there are builds queued
- After 60 minutes in general (this can be changed by our admin team if requested)

<br />

##### Stopped to Deleted

The Stopped lifectyle to Deleted lifecycle happens for two reasons:
- Something crashes (rare)
- Snapshot is deleted (see <a href="/docs/home#snapshots--snapshot-retention">Snapshots & Snapshot Retention</a> above)
