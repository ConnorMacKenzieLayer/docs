## Snapshots & Snapshot Retention

<br />

### What are snapshots?

A snapshot is a copy of a virtual machine at a specific moment in time. Snapshots help to load environments and configurations so that you can skip running steps that have not changed or that have successfully executed on previous commits.

<br />


### Algorithm for Deleting Snapshots

Listed below is a summary of how we delete snapshots. It's important to review this to learn the states of snapshots at different times.

<br />

##### 1. Split important snapshots into VIP, Important, and Not Important (VIP as the top tier).
Important Snapshots:
- Newer than 10 minutes
- Newer than a week old and the latest snapshot for an instruction
- Newer than a week old and contains the <a href="/docs/layerfile-reference#the-expose-website-instruction">EXPOSE WEBSITE</a> instruction for an open pull request
<br />
VIP Snapshots:
- 30 prioritized snapshots per paying customer as determined by tier and how recent the snapshots are
<br />
##### 2. Order Snapshot Importance (VIP, Important, Not Important)
##### 3. Delete Snapshots
Delete Process:
- Delete the oldest not important
- Delete the oldest important
- Delete the oldest VIP
