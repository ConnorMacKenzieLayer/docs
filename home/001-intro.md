# What is webapp.io?

webapp.io integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket to provide per-branch full-stack review environments.

It creates snapshots to create new copies of VMs in seconds by re-using the work previously done for earlier commits.

For example, instead of re-migrating and re-seeding a database for every environment, it would be done once and the snapshot would be re-used over and over again.
